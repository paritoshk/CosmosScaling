# CosmosScaling
Custom world creation with Cosmos Video to World model for frame prediction problem to create better simulated worlds  
# RunPod Configuration Recommendation
For the Cosmos-1.0-Autoregressive-5B-Video2World model, I recommend:
GPU: NVIDIA A100 (80GB) or H100 (80GB) - The model requires significant VRAM (41.3GB with offloading)
vCPUs: 8-16 cores
RAM: 64GB minimum
Storage: 100GB+ SSD
Container: NVIDIA PyTorch container (latest)
# System Design
Here's the architecture I propose:
Model Loading Layer: Load and initialize the Cosmos model with appropriate offloading strategies
API Layer: FastAPI service to handle inference requests
Video Processing Layer: Process input videos/images and handle output generation
Parallelization Layer: Optimize inference with CUDA and batch processing
